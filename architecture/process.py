#In this example, the code captures video frames from the webcam (or any video source specified by the cap variable). Each frame is preprocessed, passed through the Next-Level Architecture, and then displayed with an overlay indicating the predicted class label in real-time. The model weights can be loaded from a pre-trained checkpoint file (e.g., 'next_level_model.pth').

#Make sure to adjust the cap variable to the appropriate video source, such as the index of the webcam (0) or the path to a video file.

#Please note that this example assumes that you have a trained model and the necessary edge index for the GCN component. You would need to adapt and train the Next-Level Architecture on an appropriate dataset for your video editing task.

#Keep in mind that real-time video processing can be computationally intensive, and the performance may vary depending on the complexity of the model and the hardware capabilities. Optimization techniques such as model quantization or using specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs) can be considered to improve performance if needed.
