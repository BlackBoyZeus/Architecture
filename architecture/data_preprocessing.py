#In this advanced preprocessing approach, we go beyond basic image manipulation and introduce more sophisticated techniques:

#Conversion to Grayscale: Convert the input image to grayscale using the cv2.cvtColor() function.
#Adaptive Thresholding: Apply adaptive thresholding using the cv2.adaptiveThreshold() function, which adaptively determines the threshold value based on local neighborhood regions. This helps in better segmenting the foreground from the background.
#Morphological Operations: Utilize morphological operations, specifically the closing operation (cv2.morphologyEx() with cv2.MORPH_CLOSE), to enhance the image by closing small gaps and removing noise.
#Text Region Removal: Detect and remove text regions using contour detection (cv2.findContours()). By analyzing the properties of contours (e.g., bounding rectangle, area, aspect ratio), we identify text regions and create a mask to exclude them from the final processed image.
#Additional Customization: Perform any additional advanced preprocessing steps specific to your task. This may include additional filtering, edge detection, or region of interest extraction, depending on your specific requirements.
#The example usage demonstrates how to apply the advanced_preprocess_data() function to an input image and save the resulting preprocessed image.
